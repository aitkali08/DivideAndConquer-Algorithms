# Divide and Conquer Algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements several classic **Divide and Conquer algorithms** in Java and analyzes their performance.  
The algorithms include:
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Deterministic Select (Median of Medians)
- Closest Pair of Points (Computational Geometry)

The goal is to:
1. Implement these algorithms with safe recursion patterns.
2. Collect performance metrics (running time, recursion depth, comparisons, swaps, allocations).
3. Visualize the results using Python scripts.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### 1. Compile and Run Java Code
From IntelliJ IDEA or terminal:

```
mvn clean compile
```

Run the program with arguments:
```
java -cp target/classes com.aitkali.algos.Main mergesort quicksort 1000 10000 50000
```

The first arguments are algorithm names (mergesort quicksort)

The following numbers are input sizes (1000 10000 50000)

Results will be saved into a CSV file:
```
metrics.csv
```

2. Generate Graphs (Python)

Install dependencies (only once):
```
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

Run plotting script:
```
python docs/sample-plots/plot_metrics.py metrics.csv
```

This will generate .png graphs inside:
```
docs/sample-plots/
```

ðŸ“ˆ Analysis

Running Time:
QuickSort shows faster performance on average, especially for large inputs, but MergeSort provides more consistent results.

Comparisons:
MergeSort requires fewer comparisons in practice compared to QuickSort on certain inputs.

Recursion Depth (Optional):
QuickSort sometimes reaches deeper recursion, depending on pivot selection. MergeSort remains stable at O(log n) depth.

âœ… Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Divide and Conquer strategies can be applied across sorting and computational geometry.
Through experiments, we see the trade-offs:

QuickSort: faster but unstable in worst case.

MergeSort: slower but predictable with stable recursion.

The visual analysis confirms theoretical complexities:

Time complexity: O(n log n) for both sorting algorithms.

Deterministic Select: O(n) worst-case selection.

Closest Pair: O(n log n) in 2D plane.
